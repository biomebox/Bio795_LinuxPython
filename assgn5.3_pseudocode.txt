### Write the pseudocode to do the following.
### Create a list of numbers (any numbers you like).
### Then loop through the items in the list adding 1 to every number and print those numbers.


Generate a list of numbers either manually or using a python function like list and range.

For every number in that list,
    Print the number
    Add 1 to the number
    Print the new number
    Add the new number to a new list (initialize an empty list before the loop)

Print both the old and the new list
