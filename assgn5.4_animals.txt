Make a dictionary with the following information 
    (where animal names are the keys and their weights are the corresponding values in gms):
    {
    "dog" = 30000,
    "possum" = 2000,
    "cat" = 4500,
    "hummingbird" = 12
    "bat" = 18
    }

Print out only the keys of the dictionary. #print (dictionary.keys())

Put all the names of the animals in a list. #

For an animal in the list,
    Print the name of the animal
    If the animal weighs more than 20gms
        Print 'big'
    If the animal weighs less than 20 grams
        Print 'small'
