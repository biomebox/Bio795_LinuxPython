Open the file Bloom et al.

Read and ignore the first line (header line).

Read rest of the lines, and for each line:
    Break the line into a list with each value as a list object.
    Print the taxon name (first object in the list) and their diadromous state (the last object in the list).
    Add the float values of log body size to obtain a total value for all organisms (initiate the variable outside the loop).


Print the sum of the logbody sizes for all the organisms.
